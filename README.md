## How It Works

The Zscaler Client Connector (formerly Zscaler App) acts as a secure gateway for user traffic. By connecting to the Zscaler cloud platform, the application ensures that:

- All traffic is inspected for potential security threats.
- Access is granted based on policies configured by administrators.
- Performance is optimized by leveraging Zscaler’s global data center network.

The application seamlessly routes user traffic to the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, which enforces security and compliance policies while enabling direct-to-cloud connectivity.
